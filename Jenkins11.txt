MultiBranch Pipeline
=========================
This is used when developers create  multiple functionalites
code on differnet branches and upload all these branches into
the remote github.In such a case we should create a seperate
jenkinsfile for every branch and the Jenkins job should read
all these jenkinsfiles parallelly and execute the jobs
